[00:07.64] I need to disappear
[00:10.64] I might as well find a way out, oh
[00:15.49] Hear what I want to hear
[00:18.49] Easily pushin' you away now, go
[00:33.99] 
[00:23.35] If you can find a way
[00:26.24] Pretty little ego's got a hold of my soul
[00:31.01] And I know I adore you, but I'm no good for you
[00:35.33] There's no way you're changin' my mind
[00:54.33] 
[00:40.16] And you're so
[00:45.55] Stuck in your typical ways
[00:49.95] And you're so stuck in your typical ways
[01:09.95] 
[00:58.30] I'm feelin' infinite
[01:01.36] Night after night I hate myself a little more
[01:06.10] I think I'm losin' it
[01:09.09] Easily slippin' further and further down low
[01:31.09] 
[01:13.96] If you can find a way
[01:16.98] Pretty little ego's got ahold of my soul
[01:21.87] And I know I ignore you, I'm not tryin' to bore you
[01:26.02] There's no way you're changin' my mind
[01:45.02] 
[01:30.82] And you're so
[01:36.27] Stuck in your typical ways
[01:40.66] And you're so stuck in your typical ways
[02:00.66] 
[01:49.84] Feel it, I want it, I need it, I'm in control
[01:53.86] I feel the fever, the feelin', in overload
[01:57.71] I'm in, I need it, I see it, I see in your eyes
[02:21.21] 
[02:04.06] And you're so
[02:07.48] Stuck in your typical ways
[02:11.86] And you're so stuck in your typical ways, yeah
[02:34.86] 
[02:34.55] I want it, I need it
